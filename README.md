    <h2>I plan on creating <mark>multiple</mark> projects every week to show my knowledge and understanding of the languages. This is not a specific build or
project but it is just a display of my understanding of HTML elements and semantics as I
continue on my journey of learning more everyday.

    <h2>1. My Experiences So Far?
    </h2>
    <p>It's been pretty challenging learning all of these languages, but overall I enjoy learning the skill as a whole. I usually start coding first thing in the morning at 8am to about 12pm.I will start off with HTML lessons; then I will work my way all the way through CSS down to JAVASCRIPT. I find it beneficial to allow my brain to dive into each language everyday to keep my coder mind flowing & to not stay stagnent.

    <h2>2. Why I Want To Code?
    </h2>
    <p>When I was a child, I was always drawn to computers. I loved tech, games and social applications from the dawn of the age. I remember building my own myspace page and I will never forget the day Facebook launched and blew myspace out of business. I really want to be apart of the future development of society and apart of the future digital infrastructure.

          <summary>What's my favorite language?          </summary>
    <p>I don't have a favorite, I <em>"LOVE"<em>CODING in general!
    </p>
    </details>
    <p>I am already a spiritual person and I see life in a different way than others. The way I see coding is in the same manner. I see coding to be the invisible realm in the phyisical world of computers. Most of the time it is over-looked, but little do we know its the key factor to all physical life/computing life.

    <h2> 3. Where Do I See Myself In 5 Years?
    </h2>
    <p>In 5 years, I see myself going very far and creating a great name for myself in the software development space.I know things will not be easy or get easier, as it wasn't even easy for me to make it this far. Being a coder is about loving problems and being solution based. I have a great understadning of that, so I know I will be in the space for the long haul. Making a long story short, I see myslef being a "Senior Developer In 5 Years & maybe even better". After I knock out and have a clear understanding of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT; I will move on the more challenging languages like:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>PYTHON</li>
       <li>REACT</li>
       <li>SQL</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is my first coding project, so my intentions isn't to make this one super fancy. You will see my growth as I continue to implement what I learn in future projects. See you on the next update!

     <h2>1.MY FIRST HTML PROJECT (PART2/UPDATES)
     </h2>
     <p>During "Part 1" of my first HTML code; I laid a solid foundation without adding any complex elements.During this session I will be adding LINKS & 1 VIDEO. I hope you all enjoy the process and I would absolutley love to hear feedback from Senior & experienced developers! I know how far you can get just by having a student mentality & I will always be a student of the craft.
     </p>
     <h2>Here is a short video about the importance of adding links to your HTML document:
     </h2>
     <h3>Adding links to your page can not only help you, but it can absolutley help the user gather informatiom from other webs quickly & it can help the user navigate to other parts of the document quicker.
     </h3>

    <h2>2. Now That We Have "Links & Videos" On Our Page! Let's Add Some Semantics To Our HTML Document!
    </h2>
    <p>Semantics is the invisible structure of your document that gives the browser and seo a better understanding of what's going on in your HTML document. It gives clearer meanings and organization in your document. Semantics also helps you keep your code clean for future employers and collaboraters.The last thing you want to do is have sloppy code in a group project, it will slow down progress and cause avoidable confusion. I like to see Semantics as the <strong>organizer</strong> of your code</p>

    <h2>3. We've added LINKS,VIDEOS & SEMANTICS to our HTML document!</h2>
    <p>Our HTML document is now starting to come together. We have a nice structure before we even added CSS. We have 3 more elements to add:
        <ol>
            <li>AUDIO</li>
            <li>TABLES</li>
            <li>BUTTONS</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li>I will add a form and input at the end of our HTML document as well to make our web page look a little more well put together & to get interaction from the user.</li>
        </ul>
